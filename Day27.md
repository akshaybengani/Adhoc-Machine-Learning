# Day 27
*   For face recorgination use the liberary ```LBPH``` with opencv. It does not required any deep learning.
*   For Deep learning use the liberary ```dlib```, Since it is costly in terms of computation.
*   There would be a lot of issues in installation of dlib.
*   Facebook liberary for face recorgination ```face_recorgination```
*   Online API's for face recorgination.
*   YOLO(You only look ones) You just need to give image one's and it will give 90% accuracy with single data set.
*   Karios is a method which is the most business oriented API which is faster and accurate then Google or Microsoft.

# Regression
Types of Regression.
*   Linear
*   Polynomial
*   Logistic

## Linear Regression
Types of linear Regression
*   Single Independent variable equation.
    *   ```y = mx + c```
    *   When we have a single variable of attribute which affects the result we use single independent.
    *   Student marks only depend upon studyhours
*   Multi Independent variable equation.
    *   ```y = mx + c + m1x1 + m2y2```
    *   Student hours depend upon playing time,study hours, TV etc.
    *   We have multiple attributes which affects the result we use multi dependent.
## Polynomial Regression
*   This is commonly used in Stock Market prediction.
```
sal = mx + c + mx^2 + mx^3 + mx^4
```
## Task
