# Day 24
Random Forest divides your dataset in multiple small datasets and then apply decision tree classifier to all the datasets and then apply random on the results.
*   Supervised Machine Learning
    *   Label Encoding
    *   One Hot
    *   Tranin Testing
    *   Scaling
## Computer Vision
*   It is generally means that we are giving eyes to our computer system.
*   We will apply its computation by supervised learning and Neural networks.
*   Input Forms
    *   Image
    *   Video
    *   Gif
    *   Smiley
    *   Animation
*   An Image is a collection of pixels arranged in rows and columns
*   RGB & BGR are two color schemes.
*   RGB(0,0,255) Its Blue color
*   OpenCV is called as Open Computer Vision
*   To install opencv use
```
!pip install opencv-contrib-python
```
# Task

    *   Compress Image
    *   Decompress Image
*   Zoom Image in particular area and not zoom the other area of image
*   Reverse of previous
