# Task
*   HTML/CSS
    *   Create a UI with options like pandas, numpy, scikit learn, and all other things we are going to learn.
    *   
*   Write a code in python which will use GMAIL auth token to read emails.
    *  Print top 10 emails in interval of some time.
    *   We need FROM from the email
    *   Subject needed from the email
    *   Body needed from the email.
    *   Then we need to apply this to our classifier and find out its SPAM rate, or target it SPAM or HAMM.
# Day 21
*   Support Vector Regression contains two types.
    *   Support Vector Classifier
    *   Support Vector Machine
*   There are two things we have to learn in SVM is ```kernel``` and ```ganmma```.
*   How they are dependent upon each other.
*   SVM Kernel is a Huge Mathematical Formula for SVM which is used to tune SVM features.

## Random Forest
*   It is based upon Decision Tree Classifier
*   Forest basically called as Collection of Tree.
*   You can say Random Forest is an Advanced version of Decision Tree.
*   It will create multiple trees of Decision Classifier.
*   It will choose randomly from the number of end nodes of all the trees.

## Naive Based Algorithm
*   It is based upon conditional probability.
*   It is used by Gmail to filter mailed as per SMAM and HAMM.
*   Example RAN
    *   Run, Running, RAN, Runs, Runner.
    *   
*   Finding a word from the list of block words relating to the verb and its related words is called as Stemming.
*   Creating collection of words is called as stem and this process is called as stemming.

## SMTP and Python
*   It is a protocol used for communication of emails.
*   Its port number is 25.
*   MUA is Mail User Agent, It is the platform which end user uses to check and send mails.
*   MTA is Mail Transfer Agent, It is used to Transfer Mail from your MUA to Mail Server.
*   SMTPS port number is 465/513.
*   POP port number is 110
*   IMAP port number is 143
*   POPS port number is 995
*   IMAPS port number is 993
*   MDA is Mail Delivery Agent.
*
