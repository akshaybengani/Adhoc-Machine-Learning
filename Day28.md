# Day 28 Deep Learning
*   Making model better by itself by its own generated outputs, Deep analysis of your data is deep learning.
*   Deep Learning
    *   NLP (Natural Language Processing)
        *   Lexican
        *   Semantic
    *   NN (Neural Network)
        *   ANN
        *   CNN
        *   RNN
*   Stanford University build thier own systems for NLP (Natural Language Processing)
    *   Text processing
    *   Text Summarising
    *   Text Sentimental Analysis
    *   Opinion Mining
    *   Reviews
*   We can use this branch for making a Recommendation system.
*   NLP (Natural Language Processing)
    *   NLTK
        *   Natural Language Tool Kit
    *   TextBlob
    *   Spacy
*   We will be using NLTK for now
```
pip3 install nltk textblog spacy
```
* To download the dataset (3.9GB) you need to run
```
import nltk
nltk.download()
```
*   We will be using StopWords for now
```
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
```
*   To show stopwords of a language
```
stopwords.words('english')
```
*   When we search something on google, it searches via Spiders and Crawlers.
*   ```GoogleBot``` is the most powerfull Crawler which reach to every web server at least 2 times a day.
*   Some popular websites we can use for web scrapping
    *   Wikipedia
    *   Britanika
    *   php.net
*
